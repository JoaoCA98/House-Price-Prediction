Welcome to my Housing Price Prediction project repository! In this project, we aim to predict housing prices for a town or suburb based on various features of the locality. By employing data preprocessing techniques and building a linear regression model, we can predict prices for unseen data and identify the most influential features affecting house prices.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices using features associated with the locality. We focus on employing data preprocessing techniques and building a linear regression model to achieve this goal.

## Conclusions

After thorough analysis, several important insights were drawn from the data:

- A linear relationship exists between independent variables and the dependent variable, meeting the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.
- While the normality assumption of residuals wasn't entirely satisfied, the model's performance on both train and test datasets indicates no overfitting or underfitting.
- Key coefficients were identified, indicating the impact of various features on housing prices:
  - Variables like NOX, DIS, PTRATIO, LSTAT, and CRIM have a negative impact.
  - CHAS, RM, and RAD positively impact housing prices.

These findings suggest that factors such as NOX levels, distance to employment centers, pupil-teacher ratio, percentage of lower status of the population, crime rate, proximity to the Charles River, number of rooms per dwelling, and accessibility to radial highways play crucial roles in determining housing prices.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for stakeholders and policymakers:

- **Investors:** Prioritize properties with positive influencers like proximity to the Charles River or a high number of rooms. Be cautious about properties in areas with high NOX levels, far from employment centers, high crime rates, or a high percentage of lower-status population.
  
- **Policymakers:** Utilize these insights to make informed decisions that could improve the quality of life in the area. Focus on addressing factors like NOX emissions, crime rates, or accessibility to employment centers to positively impact housing values.
